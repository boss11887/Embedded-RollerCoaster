Included in this directory:

	1) Source: a folder containing the source code written for the NodeMCU-32S microcontrollers and the Node-RED dashboard project file
		1.1) b6310500066_board1/src: a folder containing the source code for the controller board
			1.1.1) main.cpp
				The main code in which containing operations relate to detect a tain wether a train will come in or go. There is a led that will illuminate when a train will come in
		1.2) b6310500295_board2/src: a folder containing the source code for the controller board
			1.2.1) main.cpp
				The main code in which containing operations relate to detect a people which are in the fast entrance. OLED is shown to the player
		1.3) b6310500350_board3/src: a folder containing the source code for the controller board
			1.3.1) main.cpp
				The main code in which containing operations relate to detect a people which are in the normal entrance. OLED is shown to the player
		1.4) b6310500325_board4/src: a folder containing the source code for the controller board
			1.4.1) main.cpp
				The main code in which containing operations relate to detect a people. If people carry object which contains a metal meterial, people will not pass entrance

		1.5) Node-RED: a folder containing the dashboard project file
			1.2.1) Dashboard.json
				A JSON file containing two Node-RED flows (Flow 1 and Flow 2.) Only Flow 2 is used to create the dashboard.

	2) LICENSE.txt: a GNU General Public License file
	
	3) README.md: a readme file describing the project and the files included in this directory
	
	4) Schematic.pdf: a schematic file detailing the construction of the two boards (sensors and controller boards.)

	5) Picture: a folder containing picture of ths project
